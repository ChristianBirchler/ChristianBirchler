### Welcome on my GitHub Portfolio 👋
I am a research assistant at the Zurich University of Applied Sciences who loves to conduct research for the software engineering community by providing usable open-source software. Look at my pinned repositories below which are the most used tools from my GitHub. Feel free to share the software and create issues or contribute with code to one of my repositories. For further details on my research you may take a look at my website: https://christianbirchler.org

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on SDC-Scissor in the context of [COSMOS](https://www.cosmos-devops.org/) (EU Horizon 2020 Project).
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with maintaining my tools, especially SDC-Scissor.
- 💬 Ask me about anything about my repositories or related research if you are curious.
